Steps:

1. **Added dependencies:** I included the necessary database dependencies for MySql in `pom.xml`.

2. **Configured properties:** I set up two separate database configurations in `application.properties` with different URLs, drivers, usernames, and passwords.

3. **Created DataSource beans:** I created two `DataSource` beans in a configuration class, one for each database.

4. **Created EntityManager beans:** I defined two `EntityManagerFactory` beans to manage the entities for both databases.

5. **Set up transaction management:** I configured two `PlatformTransactionManager` beans for handling transactions for each database.

6. **Used specific repositories:** I used custom qualifiers in repository classes to specify which database to use.
